# Hi, I'm Chris Garcia 👋

I'm a **Computer Science & Engineering major** with a **Math minor** at **Bucknell University (Class of 2027)**.  
I enjoy working across the stack — from systems and low-level programming to full-stack web development.

Currently building:

- **[Mariachi Mexican Grill](https://www.mariachimexicangrill.com/)** — a production web app using **Next.js, React, TypeScript**, and a lightweight **Supabase** backend  
- A new **full-stack agenda/task manager app** designed for speed and simplicity  

*Note: The restaurant project repository is private, but I'm happy to share code or demos if you reach out.*

## Languages/Frameworks/Tech

C/C++, Python, Java, TypeScript, React, Next.js, Supabase, SQL, Linux CLI, WSL
