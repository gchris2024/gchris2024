# Hi, I'm Chris Garcia

I'm a Computer Science & Engineering major and Math minor at Bucknell University (Class of 2027).  
I'm interested in a wide of range of software engineering, from web/desktop apps to machine learning.


Currently working on [**Mariachi Mexican Grill**](https://www.mariachimexicangrill.com/) using Next.js, React, TypeScript, & a small Supabase backend. Developing a responsive, SEO-optimized website for a local restaurant.  This is where I've been spending most of my time recently.  
*Note: The repository is private, but I can share code or demos if you reach out.*  

Lately, I've been exploring model benchmarking and performance visualizing using Python, PyTorch, & Matplotlib. Planning on posting those repos here once I get more set up.


## Languages/Frameworks

C/C++, Python, Java, TypeScript, React, Next.js, Linux CLI, WSL
